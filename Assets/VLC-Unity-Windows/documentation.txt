Welcome to VLC for Unity on Windows!


For reference, you need to a bunch of components to get this working:
- libvlc.dll, libvlccore.dll (and its plugins in /libs folder): These are nightly build DLLs of the VLC player libraries https://code.videolan.org/videolan/vlc
- Custom build of libvlcsharp, the official VideoLAN C# binding to libvlc https://code.videolan.org/videolan/LibVLCSharp
- VLCUnityPlugin.dll, the VLC-Unity native plugin https://code.videolan.org/mfkl/vlc-unity

This is all included in this package and it all works automatically for you.

LibVLCSharp docs (not Unity specific) https://code.videolan.org/videolan/LibVLCSharp/blob/3.x/docs/getting_started.md

!! You need to set your Unity target platform to "PC, Mac & Linux Standalone" to target Windows classic. Go for the x86_64 architecture.

The scene from Assets/VLC-Unity-Windows/Scripts/main.unity provides a way to get started quickly.

Regarding the integration code that you need, you will find it in UseRenderingPlugin.cs.

First, you need to load the native libraries:
```
Core.Initialize(UnityEngine.Application.dataPath);
```

You can then create LibVLCSharp objects
```
LibVLC = new LibVLC();
MediaPlayer = new MediaPlayer(LibVLC);
```

The frame updating is done in a Unity coroutine
```
IntPtr texptr = MediaPlayer.GetFrame(out bool updated);
if (updated)
{
    tex.UpdateExternalTexture(texptr);
}
```

See UseRenderingPlugin.CallPluginAtEndOfFrames() for more details.

Once that is all setup, you can create a new Media and start playback like so
```
MediaPlayer.Play(new Media(LibVLC, "http://commondatastorage.googleapis.com/gtv-videos-bucket/sample/BigBuckBunny.mp4", FromType.FromLocation));
```

To get up and running easily and quickly, I recommend you load the Assets/VLC-Unity-Windows/Scripts/main.unity scene and get started from there. 
The few lines of setup code I mentioned above are located in UseRenderingPlugin.cs.
